The Helmet and Triple Riding Violation Alert System leverages computer vision and deep learning to enhance road safety by detecting two critical violations: helmet usage and triple riding. Using the YOLOv8 object detection model, the system identifies riders and helmets from video feeds in real time. It counts the number of persons on the vehicle to detect triple riding, alerting users when more than two riders are present. Additionally, it checks if riders are wearing helmets and sends an alert if none are detected. For both violations, the system displays warnings on the video feed and sends SMS notifications via the Twilio API, ensuring immediate action can be taken. The integration of OpenCV for real-time video processing and Twilio for notifications makes this system an effective tool for promoting road safety, helping to reduce accidents caused by inadequate safety measures and overcrowded vehicles.
